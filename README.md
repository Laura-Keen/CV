## Laura Keen

I am currently training to be a full stack developer with Makers Academy. So far I have worked on some basic projects to be able to develop my skills, these are all available to view on my github profile. Working in tech excites me because it presents new challenges every day and gives me a sense of always being able to improve my work. I previously worked doing fashion buying and I find that the contrast between a highly competitive and often hostile environment fostered by the fashion industry and the collaborative nature and growth mindset in the tech industry and the open source community makes for a significant improvement in the quality of my work life.

## Projects

| **Student Directory** |

## Skills

#### Communication

- I gained great comunication skills in my previous job as I was in charge of a lot of the communications with both overseas and UK suppliers. I had to learn how to maintain a constant back and forth with over 30 different suppliers and keep track of each indidual ones progression and any issues throughout the production process.
- I have further developed these skills at Makers Academy by working with the other people in my cohort, pair programming to build new projects.

#### Problem Solving

- Problem solving is a skill that I have always enjoyed developing. In my previous role I was in charge of the entire 'critical path' of the production process which meant finding solutions to issues from external suppliers that the company often had little control over, and also finding ways to get multiple departments within the company working more efficiently as a team despite them having conflicting goals and priorities.
- Working with overseas suppliers often presented difficulties with understanding each other due to language barriers, time differences and conflicting interests. Therefore, I spent a lot of time coming up with new systems and ways of working to make it easier and more efficient for both parties.

#### Attention To Detail

- Attention to detail was a critical skill in my previous role as I handled final approvals of fabrics and prints. Working for a mid/high-end brand meant that there was an extremely high standard to uphold and every detail had to be inspected before feedback could be given to a supplier.
- My role included writing and reading over copy which would go on the website, I had to ensure there were no spelling or grammar mistakes, all the relevant details were in there and that the tone and wording fit with the brand.
- Creating detailed specification packs for suppliers was a part of my role that required intense periods of checking over small details. A single error in these packs could mean a serious cost to the company with large and expensive orders.
